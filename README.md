Just another repository for a new coder

Hi world I'm Chris aka (FishinginaSombrero8). I've been on this long journey through ducking in and out of trying to learn to code.
Even getting to this stage with GitHub, where I'm crearing this first -commit- took me a while as I was just terrified I might break someones code and 
would much rather not interfere or mess up all the good work going on this platform.

FreeCodeCamp brought me here as I've been trying to learn through them and so far it's been painful, if I'm honest. Long nights hahaha.
